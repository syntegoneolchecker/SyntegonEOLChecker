name: "CodeQL Config - SSRF Suppressions"

# Query filters to suppress specific security alerts
query-filters:
  # Suppress SSRF warnings for the scraping service
  # This service intentionally fetches user-provided URLs for web scraping
  # Comprehensive validation is in place (see utils/validation.js)
  - exclude:
      id: js/request-forgery
  - exclude:
      id: js/server-side-unvalidated-url-redirection

  # Suppress format string warnings for logging
  # User-controlled URLs are logged for debugging purposes
  # Risk is minimal: template literals don't have format specifiers, URLs are validated,
  # and this is an internal-only service where log injection has no security impact
